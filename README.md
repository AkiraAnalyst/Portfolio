This process involved:

- Populating the property address data
- Breaking out the address into individual columns (Address, City, State)
- Changing Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field
- Removing duplicates
- Deleting unused columns after breaking out the address into individual columns & standardizing the data format
