# SQL Data Cleaning Portfolio
In this project I used SQL to clean data. 
This process involved:
- Standardizing the date format
- Populating the property address data
- Breaking out the address into individual columns (Address, City, State)
- Changing Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field
- Removing duplicates
- Deleting unused columns after breaking out the address into individual columns & standardizing the data format
